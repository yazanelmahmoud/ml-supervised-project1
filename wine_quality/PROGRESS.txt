  PROJECT 1 — WINE QUALITY — PROGRESS
================================================================================

TASK: Multiclass classification (quality - discrete rating/class)
      Dataset: Wine Quality (Red + White)
      Metrics: Macro-F1 and Accuracy (minimum). Include confusion matrix and per-class performance discussion.
      EDA → Hypotheses → 4 algos → Interpretation.
      Algos: DT, kNN, SVM, NN (sklearn + PyTorch, SGD only).

[ ] Setup: config, data_loading, preprocessing, eda, models_*, evaluation, utils, notebook.
[ ] EDA: class_distribution, missing/dtypes, numeric/categorical summaries, plots → outputs/
[ ] EDA Summary (EDA_SUMMARY.txt) + preprocessing.py: determine preprocessing steps
[ ] Hypotheses: hypothesis.txt — theory-based, testable hypotheses for ML experiments.
[ ] Preprocessing: implement in preprocessing.py based on EDA findings
[ ] Decision Trees (DT): split criterion, pruning/regularization, tuning via CV, 
    learning curves, model-complexity curve, runtime table, confusion matrix, 
    final depth/leaves; hypothesis revisited in conclusions.
[ ] k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN): model-complexity (k × weights × metric), learning 
    curves, test evaluation, runtime table, confusion matrix; hypothesis revisited.
[ ] Support Vector Machines (SVM): kernel selection, C/gamma tuning, learning 
    curves, test evaluation, runtime table, confusion matrix; hypothesis revisited.
[ ] Neural Networks (sklearn): architecture tuning, learning curves, test evaluation, 
    runtime table, confusion matrix; hypothesis revisited.
[ ] Neural Networks (PyTorch): architecture tuning, learning curves, test evaluation, 
    runtime table, confusion matrix; compare with sklearn version.
[ ] Cross-model comparison & conclusion (after all algos done)
